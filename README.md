PROBLEMS:
-creeps get re-assigned src for harvesting each tick => when new spawn, they switch

FEATURES:
-when adding spawns to queue, make for loop to add all the missing creeps? (only for imporant classes)
-make harvesters first fill up extensions, because Spawn earns a small amount of energy each tick on its own
[x]make harvester always top priority spawn ==> other spawns depend on it
-prioritize building queue ==> roads last to be built
-function to calculate creep cost
-function to calculate total energy stored
